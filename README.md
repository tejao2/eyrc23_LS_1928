**Project Name: Lunar Scout - Omni Wheel Self-Balancing Bike Robot**

**Description:**
Lunar Scout is an innovative omni wheel self-balancing bike robot designed for patrolling and scouting the challenging terrain of the lunar colony. Equipped with advanced self-balancing technology and auto-steering features, Lunar Scout effortlessly navigates through rough lunar landscapes, signaling potential hazards or emergencies to the command center. This project was developed as part of eYRC 2023-24, focusing on enhancing skills in control systems, mathematical modeling, mechanical design, embedded systems, and programming.

**Key Features:**
